# learn-to-code

This guide provides a list of **free resources** to help you learn the basics of computer science and dive into JavaScript programming. This approach is challenging but rewarding, giving you a strong theoretical foundation along with practical coding skills.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Core Learning Path

**[Harvards CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)**

This is your main course to dive into. CS50 is Harvardâ€™s intro to computer science, and itâ€™s a great way to learn how computers work, covering the basics of programming with languages like **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **C**. Starting with CS50 will give you a bigger-picture view, helping you understand not just how to code but also the fundamentals of computer science itself. Itâ€™s definitely a challenge, but itâ€™s super rewarding and youâ€™ll end up with a really solid foundation thatâ€™ll make the rest of your learning so much easier and more meaningful.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Enrollment Instructions**: Enroll through [edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science). It will ask if you want to purchase a verified certificate, but you donâ€™t need to buy this. At the end of the course, Harvard will provide you with a **free certificate**.

### 2. JavaScript Practice Series

Alongside the core learning path, you can start learning the basics of JavaScript with this video series. It provides hands-on practice, letting you experiment with real code as you go. This way, youâ€™re building up both computer science knowledge and practical coding skills at the same time!

> [!NOTE]  
> **Enrollment Instructions**: Thereâ€™s no enrollment here; just follow along with the video, try writing code, and start getting comfortable with JavaScript concepts.
