### 1. Core Learning Path

**[Harvards CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)**

This is your main course to dive into. CS50 is Harvard’s intro to computer science, and it’s a great way to learn how computers work, covering the basics of programming with languages like **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **C**. Starting with CS50 will give you a bigger-picture view, helping you understand not just how to code but also the fundamentals of computer science itself. It’s definitely a challenge, but it’s super rewarding and you’ll end up with a really solid foundation that’ll make the rest of your learning so much easier and more meaningful.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Enrollment Instructions**: Enroll through [edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science). It will ask if you want to purchase a verified certificate, but you don’t need to buy this. At the end of the course, Harvard will provide you with a **free certificate**.

### 2. JavaScript Practice Series

Alongside the core learning path, you can start learning the basics of JavaScript with these resources. They provide hands-on practice, letting you experiment with real code as you go. This way, you’re building up both computer science knowledge and practical coding skills at the same time!

#### 1. [JavaScript for Beginners (YouTube - Programming with Mosh)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk)

This video tutorial is a fantastic, beginner-friendly introduction to JavaScript. It explains core JavaScript concepts in a straightforward and approachable way, helping you get comfortable with the language’s syntax and logic.

#### 2. [Introduction to JavaScript (Codecademy)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

Codecademy’s Introduction to JavaScript course is an interactive learning experience, allowing you to write and test JavaScript code right in your browser. It covers basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, and functions, with built-in quizzes and checkpoints to ensure you’re understanding each topic. As you progress, Codecademy provides feedback on your code, which helps reinforce your learning through real-time practice.

#### 3. [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (freeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/)

This freeCodeCamp module dives deeper into JavaScript, covering essential algorithms and data structures. It’s a more in-depth resource that moves beyond basic syntax to help you understand how to solve problems and think algorithmically with JavaScript.

*Note: This course assumes completion of the [Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/), so consider starting there if you’re new to HTML and CSS.*
